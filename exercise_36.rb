# Exercise 36
# Write a method, replace_elements!, that replaces elements in the array with their corresponding values from a hash
# Your method should accept an array and a hash as input.
# The method should mutate the given array by replacing elements with their corresponding values in the hash.
# The method should return the given array.
#
# Note: this method has a BANG!, thus, it must MUTATE the input array. 
# This means that the object_id of the input array should be identical to the object_id of the returned array. 

def replace_elements!(array, hash)
    array.map! { |el| i = array.find_index(el); hash.default = el; array[i] = hash[el] }
end

# check_solution runs a single test case and prints whether it was
# successful or not.
def check_solution(test_number, array, hash, expected)
    actual = replace_elements!(array, hash)
    if actual != expected
        puts "Test ##{test_number}: Incorrect value: got #{actual}, expected #{expected}"
        return false
    end
    if array.object_id != actual.object_id
        puts "Test ##{test_number}: Incorrect, must mutate original value"
        return false
     end

    puts "Test ##{test_number}: Correct"
    return true

# run_tests runs each of the test cases.
