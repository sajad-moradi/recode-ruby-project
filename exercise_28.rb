# Exercise 28
# You will write a method, sum_of_evens to sum up all even numbers that are given to you
# Your method should accept an array of Integers
# The method should return the total of all the even numbers in the array added up
# You must use inject in this method

# Write Your method code here
def sum_of_evens(array)
    array.inject(0) { |acc, el| el.even? ? acc + el : acc }
end
# Driver Code: Do not edit under this line

# check_solution runs a single test case and prints whether it was
# successful or not.
def check_solution(test_number, array, expected)
    actual = sum_of_evens(array)
    if actual != expected
        puts "Test ##{test_number}: Incorrect value: got #{actual}, expected #{expected}"
        return false
    end

    puts "Test ##{test_number}: Correct"
    return true
end

# run_tests runs each of the test cases.
