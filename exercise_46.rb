# Exercise 46
# You will write a method, danish that changes the first occurrence 
# of the word apple, blueberry, or cherry in a string to danish.
# Your method should accept a string
# The method should return a string

# Write Your method code here
def danish(string)
  string.sub(/\bapple|blueberry|cherry\b/, 'danish')
end
# Driver Code: Do not edit under this line

# check_solution runs a single test case and prints whether it was
# successful or not.
def check_solution(test_number, argument, expected)
  actual = danish(argument)
  if actual != expected
    puts "Test ##{test_number}: Incorrect value: got #{actual}, expected #{expected}"
    return false
  end

  puts "Test ##{test_number}: Correct"
  return true
end

# run_tests runs each of the test cases.
