# Sum of Natural Numbers: Recursion
# Given a number n, find sum of first n natural numbers recursively.
# For example, if the number n is 6, it would return:
# 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21
# You have to use recursion in this problem
# You have to determine what are the arguments required for sum
# You can create additional nested methods if you need to

def sum(n)
  return 0 if n == 0
  return 1 if n == 1
  resault = n + sum(n - 1)
end

puts sum(9) == 45
puts sum(7) == 28
puts sum(3) == 6
puts sum(0) == 0
