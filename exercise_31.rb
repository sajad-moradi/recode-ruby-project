# Exercise 31
# You will write a method, filter_lengths, that filters an array of strings to a minimum length that is also provided
# Your method should accept an array of strings and an Integer as the length. 
# The method should return an array containing the strings that have at least the given length.
# The length argument should be optional - if no length is provided, then 5 should be used as the length.

# Write Your method code here
def filter_lengths(array, num = 5)
    array.select {|el| el.length >= num}
end
