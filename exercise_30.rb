# Exercise 30
# You will write a method, adult_in_group? to check if there is any person in the array who is an adult
# Your method shall accept an array containing people. Each person is represented as a hash.
# The method should return true if there is at least 1 person with an age of 18 or greater.
# The method should return false otherwise.

# Write Your method code here
def adult_in_group?(array)
array.any? {|person| person[:age] >= 18 }
end

# check_solution runs a single test case and prints whether it was
# successful or not.
