*Figure 1*.  Animation solving a Tower of Hanoi puzzle


There is a story about an ancient temple in India (Some say it’s in Vietnam – hence the name Hanoi) that has a large room with three towers surrounded by 64 golden disks.

These disks are continuously moved by priests in the temple. According to a prophecy, when the last move of the puzzle is completed the world will end.

These priests acting on the prophecy, follow the immutable rule by Lord Brahma of moving these disk one at a time...

[Tower of Hanoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi) (also known as Tower of Brahma) is a mathematical game or puzzle. The objective is to move all the disks on one rod to another rod, with the following rules:

* Only one disk can be moved at a time.
* Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
* No larger disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

To solve the puzzle, the entire stack of disks have to be moved and placed in ascending order (from large to small) on the destination rod.

## Progression
### Pre-release: Understanding Tower of Hanoi moves
Try and visualise a game of Tower of Hanoi and see if you can break down the puzzle solving aspect into a general equation and base case. If you are unable to visualise this, try working backwards - what is the last move that needs to be made before you complete the puzzle and win the game? Work backwards from there and see if there are any patterns...

Before we begin coding, let's develop and write a pseudocode solution for your solver.


### 1st Iteration: Basic Logic
We're going to write a method that performs and solves the Tower of Hanoi puzzle iteratively.


### 2nd Iteration: Recursion
We're going to write a method that performs and solves the Tower of Hanoi puzzle recursively.


## Conclusion
Tower of Hanoi is a classic Computer Science interview question. Getting your head around how the recursiveness works for Tower of Hanoi will be very useful so you would be able to utilise recursion even if it involves more than one variable at a time.
